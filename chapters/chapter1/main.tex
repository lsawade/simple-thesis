\lipsum[1-2]


The well known Pythagorean theorem \(x^2 + y^2 = z^2\) was 
proved to be invalid for other exponents. 
Meaning the next equation has no integer solutions:

\begin{equation}
	x^n + y^n = z
	.
\end{equation}

The patch of sky in which the galaxies reside was chosen because it had a low density of bright stars in the near-field.''
